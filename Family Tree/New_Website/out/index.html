            <h2>How it all started:</h2>
            <p>
                The Groths established themselves for centuries in the vicinity of Stolp city and country, and Schlawe country. Groths were mentioned in the Chronicles and can be found in Heraldic books with a bourgeois coat of arms.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                1881 Stolp had 20,000 inhabitants. Pommerania was a province of the Prussia Kingdom. Since Jan 18, 1871 the King of Prussia was also Kaiser of the Deutsches Reich (union of the South and North German states).
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Ernst Ludwig Hermann Groth was born on Aug. 21,1831 in Annaburg, county of Stolp / Pommerania. His parents were farmers. At that time, only a small family coule support themselves, so usually some of the children left for town to either
                learn a trade or they would work as farmers for a landlord. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> 
                Hermann moved to Gross-Schloenwitz, got married there on Jan. 24, 1854 to a Hanna Henriette Dorothea Kuester, born in 1836. First they moved to Klein-Runow and later to
                Reinholdsfelde / Sagerke. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Through friends they heard that Amerika was looking for settlers and, because tihe situation for farmworkers was unfavorable, plus they wanted a better future for their children, son Hermann started
                out to Amerika as an "explorer". So, trusting God, in the spring of 1881, Hermann & Henriette left their Pommneranian homeland and took the trip on, the steamer Vandalia from Hamburg on the day of 
                March 20 into the New World. With them were their daughters Albertine and Adeline and their sons Albert, Julius, Heinrich and Otto. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Their oldest son Karl, born in 1854 was married to Wilhelmine Dombrowa in 1879.
                They expected Karl to join them in Amerika, but his wife was afraid to cross the large ocean, also Karl was serving his time as a calvary-man (Husar). Therefore they stayed in Pommerania and they bought property from their savings in
                Stolp and remained to live there until their death. The children Heinrich, Franz, Emma and Margarere also resided in Stolp with their families until 1945. From that year on they either left as refugees or, were driven away by the Soviets/Poles.
                Son Willy had lived in Berlin with his family.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                1955 the Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Federal Republic of Germany) entered the N.A.T.O.
                Since then, the American Groths from the county of Stolp and the German Groths have finally been reunited politically.
